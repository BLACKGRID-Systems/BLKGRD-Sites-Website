# **[BLACKGRID Sites](https://sites.blkgrd.net) — Web Development Landing & Client Preview Platform**

**[sites.blkgrd.net](https://sites.blkgrd.net)** is the primary landing environment for **BLACKGRID Sites**, a web development and digital infrastructure studio branch of BLACKGRID. The platform delivers a clean, high-performance interface built with **static HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is deployed through **GitHub Pages** for reliability, speed, and transparent version control.

The site serves two core functions:

1. **Client Engagement & Onboarding**
   A streamlined contact portal where clients can reach out for professional website development, frontend engineering, and custom digital solutions powered by BLACKGRID’s diverse technical stack.

2. **Live Client Preview Hosting**
   A temporary hosting system located under the `/view/` directory, enabling clients to view in-progress or pre-deployment versions of their websites (e.g., `sites.blkgrd.net/view/example.com`). This provides real-time visibility during development cycles across various tech stacks and architectures.

Designed with a focus on brand consistency, performance, and scalability, **BLACKGRID Sites** represents the central hub for client interaction and project staging within the BLACKGRID ecosystem.
